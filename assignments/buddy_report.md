# Buddy Report
Give your honest appraisal of each of your buddies' progress:

* Did they seem like they gave a good, honest effort?  
* Did they get stuck somewhere?
* What ideas were shared / what was discussed during your interactions?
* What did you learn from them?
* Anything else you want to add.

A report for each buddy only needs to be a paragraph.  This Buddy Progress Report is _*in no way*_ connected to your Buddy's grade.  It is, however, tied to your grade so be sure to provide an accurate report!
