# HW #3
For this assignment, you will delve into the basics of data analysis using Python.  As always, you are welcome to select a topic or area that is of particular interest to you.  If you cannot think of anything in particular, you can analyze the dataset that I provide.  This dataset contains students' test results and their eventual course grades in a computer science course.  Your task is to determine whether or not there is a relationship between scores on the test and the final course grade (either letter or percentage).  Also, determine whether or not there was a gain in test performance between pre and post tests for individual students and for the class as a whole. In addition, you are to discover if whether or not there exist differences in grades and/or test scores between instructors (A and B) and terms (1 and 2).  

Note that as is often the case when performing data analysis, the data provided is incomplete -- not everyone who took the pre-test also took the post-test.  As such, you may have to "throw out" unmatched pre/post test pairs and "incomplete" records.  Making such decisions is left to your discretion.

## Minimum Requirements
Your assignment will be graded based both on the script you develop to answer your questions as well as the writeup you provide.  The writeup should be in a Juypter notebook file.  Your code can also be there, but you may need to write separate scripts as well.  I leave that up to you.  In order to receive full credit, you must provide statistical analysis for the questions that I provide in the overview.  If you are doing your own analysis, you will be expected to provide an equivalent level of data analysis for your chosen dataset.  

## Buddy Assignments

## Grading
This assignment is worth 50 points.  Your grade will be based on the following:
* Completing the project *_OR_*
* Demonstrating regular progress as evident by a) consistent Github checkins and b) issue tracking and/or progress board updates
* Maintaining a [design diary](../design_diary_prompts.md) for this assignment (place in the root of your project repository)
* Completing a [buddy progress report](../buddy_report.md) for each of your buddies.  You will submit your buddy report confidentially through Canvas.

## Due Date
This assignment is due midnight, March 13, 2020.  You will turn in your project by checking your code into github, submitting a link to that repository on Canvas, and submitting your buddy reports. Next, create an GIF walkthrough of your program using [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) (also available as a standalone EXE in this project's [utility folder](../../utils)).  Upload this image to your repository and put a link to the image in your reflection. *Be sure to place your reflection in _the root folder_ of your repository!*
